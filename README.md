## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Using grid is much better to use for bigger projects than flexbox although I believe this one could also be possible to make using flexbox instead.
The mode switch was a nice touch and the main reason I wanted to make this challenge. CSS variables and mixing it in SCSS with $ variables was something I had to actually look up for.
